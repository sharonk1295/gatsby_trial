## ðŸ’« Technologies Used ðŸ’« 

1.  **Gatsby**

    Wanting to dive deeper into React, I utilized one of its most popular frameworks, Gatsby. I appreciate all the plugins Gatsby and third party sources have to offer. Working with Gatsby greatly improved my site's speed and makes clicking around feel incredibly fast for the user. 

2.  **GraphQL**

    Working with Gatsby was super intuitive because the tech comes with GraphQL built into it. While in development mode, I was able to utilize the IDE to query through my data and fetch exactly what I needed through a single request (as opposed to REST APIs).
